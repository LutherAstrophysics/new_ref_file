Image [m23_7.0-0099.fit](./m23_7.0-0099.fit) is the image from 2012-07-16
aligned combined image number 99.  This image was chosen as the new reference
for a couple reasons:
1. It had the most stars (out of all 2012 images) from ref_revised_71 when
generated logfile combined using
[m23](https://github.com/lutherastrophysics/m23) version `1.16.3`. 
1. The LTPR for the night wasn't too bad bad i.e 0.012961.
1. The night was new moon.

Note that the images were calibrated using masterflat from June 16 2012
